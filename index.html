    <p>Royal Tulip - First Beach Resort in Cox's Bazar.The temperature of the sun is steadily increasing, warming the earth more than ever before. In this increasing heat, all of a sudden we got an offer to go for a tour to a majestic new hotel in Cox's
        Bazar. I did not have to think twice. I jumped on the 12 a.m. bus and reached my destination, while in deep slumber throughout the journey. We reached Kalatoli and a minibus arrived to pick me up from the hotel lounge, where all the guests are
        received from, and took me to the hotel. Without even thinking about the extreme heat, the appeal of going near the sea started increasing. The bus started and our next stop was to be the one and only 5-star Hotel Royal Tulip. </p>

    <p>The hotel is strategically located between the sea and the locality. After 40 minutes of traversing through the natural beauty, at last the royal reception of Sea Pearl was in sight! The Sea Pearl is the lobby after getting off the bus. Everyone had
        a camera! And why wouldn't they? We could see the long-awaited beauty of the sea from the lobby, for which we came for. Such a sight is indeed very rare. But, again our attention came back to the hotel compound. The blue water, and the Amoeba
        Swimming Pool full of music everywhere; I was instantly thinking of how spoiling the luxuriant environment was. Meanwhile, everybody got their room keys. Barely after getting freshened up, everyone was instantly at the pool side! </p>
